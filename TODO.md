# Carrom Pool AI Aim Implementation Progress

## Core Components
- [x] Create main game page (src/app/page.tsx)
- [x] Build interactive carrom board component (src/components/CarromBoard.tsx)
- [x] Implement game pieces with physics (src/components/GamePiece.tsx)

## AI System
- [x] Develop core AI logic and trajectory calculations (src/lib/carrom-ai.ts)
- [x] Build physics engine for realistic game simulation (src/lib/physics.ts)
- [x] Create geometry utilities for mathematical calculations (src/lib/geometry.ts)

## Visual Overlays
- [x] Build AI aim overlay system (src/components/AimOverlay.tsx)
- [x] Create shot assistance interface (integrated in GameControls.tsx)
- [x] Implement trajectory visualization components

## Game Interface
- [x] Design game controls panel (src/components/GameControls.tsx)
- [x] Create scoreboard and game state display (integrated in GameControls.tsx)
- [x] Build game modes selector (integrated in main page.tsx)

## Game Logic
- [x] Implement game state management (src/lib/game-state.ts)
- [x] Create carrom game hook (src/hooks/use-carrom-game.ts)
- [ ] Add custom styling (src/styles/carrom.css)

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Install dependencies and build project
- [ ] Test AI calculations and physics simulation
- [ ] Validate visual overlays and user interactions
- [ ] Deploy and test final application

## Completed
- [x] Project setup and planning
- [x] TODO file creation
- [x] Core utility libraries (geometry, physics, AI)
- [x] Game state management system
- [x] React hooks for game logic
- [x] Interactive game components
- [x] AI overlay and visualization system
- [x] Main game interface and controls
- [x] Responsive game board with SVG graphics
- [x] Complete carrom game implementation
